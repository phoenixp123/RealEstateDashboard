# RealEstateDashboard

## Overview
This is a Django web application that uses data aggregated from various publicly available APIs including Zillow, Realtor.com, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics to display statistics about the American housing market. The Heroku instance that this application runs on is no longer available, but a detailed overview can be found at the video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a7RIozFy7AlreIEVp1acSZqgZoruFpVu/view?usp=sharing).
